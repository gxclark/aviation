Of these many options for MSTR customers, we have selected a few that are popular choices for our customers, as we see some of them migrate to a new data platform to support their Business Intelligence and Analytics workloads.

* We started off with organizing the data in PostgreSQL, due to the excellent spatial and data integration capabilities of this tool.
* We have already started to use Snowflake as an excellent Cloud DWH, and have plans expand this.
* We also want to build an example using Databricks, possibly using the raw CSV data in AWS S3, or better yet Parquet formatted enriched data.
* We plan to build these workloads in AWS Redshift, which is only a hop, skip and jump from our original PostgreSQL design.
* Also, we plan to build on Google BigQuery, as another excellent Cloud DWH option, but which has its own unique technology.
* As time permits, we might try some advanced options, like a graph database (Neo4J?)
